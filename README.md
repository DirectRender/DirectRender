- 👷 Working as a Technical Artist in Unreal Engine (mostly) and also doing freelancing over at UE's marketplace. Selling tools to make it easier for other developers.
- 👷 I'm mostly doing shaders, tools and optimization. Optimization is what I love the most by far.
- 👀 On a daily basis I usually talk with the GPU through HLSL or C++, but also doing profiling work throughout Unreal's profiler and also RenderDoc.
- ✈️ Fun fact: I started learning C++ first and then moved to C# and LUA thereafter.
